###How you can help###

This project is still a work in progress, and there is much ground to cover before it can be considered stable.  There are a number of ways you can help with reaching our goal of providing a robust, easy-to-use and well-documented finished product:

* Run the unit test suite against your Desire2Learn development environment and report the results back to a member of the core maintainers list
* Report any issues you encounter while using our code to the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/adamlundrigan/zfD2L/issues)
* Add/update documentation and/or code examples on the project wiki
* Fill in gaps in the unit test suite
* Tackle an outstanding issue from the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/adamlundrigan/zfD2L/issues)
* Implement SOAP API methods which are currently missing/incomplete

###Getting Started###
If you are interested in contributing source code or documentation updates back to our project, you only need two things to get started:

1. __GitHub Account__: You can sign up for a GitHub account at [www.github.com](https://github.com/).  It's free and super easy!

2. __Git Client Software__:  Git is a distributed version control system.  For instructions on how to install Git on Windows, Mac or Linux and configure it for use with GitHub, see [this Help.GitHub page](http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/)

Once you have completed both of those steps, fork our project into your own GitHub account and get crackin'!  If you are new to GitHub, the *Beginner* section on [Help.GitHub](http://help.github.com) is a fantastic resource.  Our suggestion is to start with the [Fork a Repo](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) page and work your way through the section from there.
